This is the Javascript version of the [`{signature.r}`](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/signature.r) and [`{signature.py}`](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/signature.py) application.

This application provides a graphical interface to streamline the creation and maintenance of your email signature.

No more wrestling with images or getting tangled up in HTML code; the application offers a set of fields to update your signature easily.

Simply enter your name, first name, email, and other necessary information to populate your signature.

Additionally, the application allows you to copy the HTML code with a single button click, making it easy to paste into your email client settings.

Lastly, updating the banner (the image at the bottom of the signature) and the associated link for redirection is straightforward. You no longer need to request everyone to update their signature individually for these changes.
